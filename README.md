An IOT solution to detect her lost phone (using esp-01)

My wife always demands me to find her lost phone, well, not exactly lost, just placed somewhere inside the house some time ago (more than 5 minutes threshold) and forgotten. 

So asks me very frequently to call her phone to find it, and that interruption has an impact on my ability to concentrate on more important things (like view my loved serial).

To be honest I have been in that situation myself often. So actually I've built two of those devices...
